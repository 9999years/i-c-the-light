# I C the Light

*a distance estimating ray marcher written in C*

On ray marching (from [Syntopia](http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2011/06/distance-estimated-3d-fractals-part-i/)):

> Classic raytracing shoots one (or more) rays per pixel and calculates where the
> rays intersect the geometry in the scene. Normally the geometry is described by
> a set of primitives, like triangles or spheres, and some kind of spatial
> acceleration structure is used to quickly identify which primitives intersect
> the rays.
>
> Distance Estimation, on the other hand, is a ray marching technique.
>
> Instead of calculating the exact intersection between the camera ray and the
> geometry, you proceed in small steps along the ray and check how close you are
> to the object you are rendering. When you are closer than a certain threshold,
> you stop. In order to do this, you must have a function that tells you how
> close you are to the object: a Distance Estimator. The value of the distance
> estimator tells you how large a step you are allowed to march along the ray,
> since you are guaranteed not to hit anything within this radius.

### Code

`color.h`:
Micro-library for converting colors between `(unsigned int) 0xFFFFFF` and `unsigned char *{0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF}` formats.

`test.c`:
Unit tests. Currently only tests `color.h`.

`icthelight.c`:
The beef of the code lives here.
Can be redirected to a log file for some supplementary (but non-essential) output.

### Misc

`license.txt`:
A copy of the MIT license; see below.

`Makefile`:
Super simple makefile, crafted by hand.

`readme.md`:
This file.

## Branches

Approximately ordered from most to least stable.

`master`:
(Usually) stable builds and major progress.

(Maybe some day) `beta`:
Unstable builds but not necessarily a horrible mess.
Will generally be far ahead from `master`.

`mess`:
Commits almost certainly guaranteed not to work.
Do not check these out; theyâ€™re just for me to store work for later.

## Coming soon...

* Binary downloads of the SDL DLLs from my website
* Gallery of output on my website

## License

I C the Light is licensed under the MIT license, a copy of which is included in `license.txt`.
